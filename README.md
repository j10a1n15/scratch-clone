# Scratch-Clone
This is only a copy of [this project](https://github.com/LLK/), written by myself.
My point is not to copy Scratch in any way, this is only for a school project.

## Requirements
1. Node.js 0.10 or higher

## Getting started
```sh
git clone https://github.com/j10a1n15/scratch-clone.git
cd scratch-clone
npm install
npm start
```
